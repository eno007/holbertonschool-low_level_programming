# Debugging
Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works.

In software development, the debugging process begins when a developer locates a code error in a computer program and is able to reproduce it. Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle.

Below you will see some examples how to apply debugging:
- [0-main.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/0-main.c)
**This file must test that the function ``positive_or_negative()`` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.**
- [1-main.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/1-main.c)
**Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.**
- [2-main.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/2-main.c)
**This program prints the largest of three integers.**
- [3-convert_day.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/3-convert_day.c)
**This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.**
- [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)
**A function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.**
