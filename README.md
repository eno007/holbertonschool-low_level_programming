# Holberton School Low level Programming

C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. 
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

In this group of tasks you will see how `C programming` will work and become the most fun way to solve different tasks faster and in a more efficient way. Below you will see projects dived in these classes:

- [Hello World](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/hello_world)
- [Variables `if` , ``else`` and ``while``](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variables_if_else_while)
- [Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/functions_nested_loops)
- [Debugging](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/debugging)
