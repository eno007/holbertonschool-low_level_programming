# Variables if, else and while

In this part you will be able to see a variety of tasks in order to look closely aplications of variables, and ``if - else`` and loop ``while``. Tasks are as below:

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
**This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.**
- [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
**This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.**
- [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
**A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.**
- [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
**C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.**
- [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
**C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.**
- [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
**C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.**
- [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
**C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.**
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
**A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.**
- [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
**C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.**
- [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)
**A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.**
- [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)
**A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.**
- [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)
**A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.**
- [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/eno007/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)
**A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.**
