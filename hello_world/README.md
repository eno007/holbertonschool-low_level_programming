# Hello World

In this file you will see tasks that will have these objectives:
1. Why C programming is awesome
2. Who invented C
3. Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
4. What happens when you type ``gcc main.c``
5. What is an entry point
6. What is ``main``
7. How to print text using ``printf``, ``puts`` and ``putchar``
8. How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator ``sizeof``
9. How to compile using ``gcc``
10. What is the default program name when compiling with ``gcc``
11. What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with ``betty-style``
12. How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
13. How does the ``main`` function influence the return value of the program`

Below the tasks are going to execute this type of requirements in order for you to understand how to put that to practice.
